## The Unfair Game (by Sebastiaan and Jeffrey)

The Unfair Game is a game based on Unfair Mario. 
The main character his name is Gerard. ![Gerard](https://github.com/J3G0/gba-sprite-engine/blob/master/unfairGame/sprite/Gerard/Gerard-large.png) and his evil counterpart is the Saaientist (Scientist). ![Scientist](https://github.com/J3G0/gba-sprite-engine/blob/master/unfairGame/sprite/Saaientist/Mad%20Saaientist%20large.png).

When first loading the game, a start scene is previewed with the current amount of deaths (yes, it has a counter and you will find out why) and instruction how to load the next scene. <br/>

If you somehow make it into the final boss fight, be prepared for a fight!
While trying to dodge the massive amount of testtubes or fireballs he throws at you, pressing START will spawn a bomb. This bomb has to explode while the scientist is near it in order to damage him!  <br/>
